# SFMono-nerd-font

This repository contains a patched version of **SF Mono** font, customized to include additional glyphs from the **Nerd Fonts** collection. This makes the font suitable for use in terminal applications, code editors, and development environments that require icons for various programming tools, such as Git, Docker, and more.

## About SF Mono

**SF Mono** is the monospaced typeface developed by Apple, primarily used for coding and development purposes. It has a clean and modern design, perfect for terminal use. However, by default, it lacks many icons and glyphs useful in developer tools.

## Nerd Fonts

[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) is a project that patches popular fonts with a collection of over 3,000 glyphs, including icons for file types, programming tools, and other useful symbols. The goal of this project is to make it easier to use icon fonts in your development setup, without the need for additional plugins or external dependencies.
